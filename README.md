Business Data Management

Capstone Project
An Analysis of Sales, COVID impact and Gross Profit of a Surgical Supply Business.

ABC Distributors (The Business) deals in Surgical Supply business and generally deals in surgical items like IV Fluids, Syringes, Suture, Gloves, Masks and other related items. The Business is based in Delhi and does the business locally as well as centrally around neighboring cities and states.
The business maintains its overall data on an ERP System. Since the data is sizeable, for the purpose of this analysis, sales and purchase data of FY2020-21 & FY2021-22(till 31 Jan) and detailed Item-wise sales, for the fiscal FY2020-2021 was recorded.
I collected the data by getting in touch with the owner of the business while discussing the overall idea behind the project. 
My objective is to analyze the overall sales, purchase with respect to the location of clients, and item-based analysis during the COVID periods.
Observations:
1.	The business made the least revenue in April of FY2020-21 due to COVID-19 Lockdown and the most revenue in June of FY2020-21 due to very high demand of COVID-19 related items (Sanitizer, Masks, Gloves etc.)
2.	Q3 of FY2020-21 and Q1 of FY2021-22 generated highest revenue.
3.	About 6 key categories of items constitutes 80% of the overall revenue.
4.	Gross Margin of the business for FY2020-21 was 43%.
5.	East Delhi contributes towards the highest revenue.
Recommendations:
1.	The sales in November and December can be increased as they have been consistently low compared with other months for last two fiscal.
2.	There is still margin to increase selling price for the top key categories. 
3.	The business can expand more in South and Central Delhi as they have good presence of hospitals there.
4.	Suture gives the second-best Gross Margin. The inventory for it should be increased as it has larger expiry period compared to others.
